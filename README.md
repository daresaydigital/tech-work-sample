# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tools

Node v16.17.1

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Work sample - Application developer

## Assignment

- Build an awesome movie app that shows popular and high rated movies.
- Code it for the platform (Android, iOS, web) you applied for or the one you prefer.

## Requirements

- Use an open https://developers.themoviedb.org/open source API. Please read the API [Authentication section](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/authentication) to get started.
- Discover most popular and highly rated movies.
- Display the movies with creative look and feel of an app to meet design guidelines for your platform (Material Design etc.).
- Launch a detail screen whenever a particular movie is selected.

## Examples of bonus features

- Allow user to save a favorite movie for offline access.
- Allow user to read movie reviews.

## We expect you to

- Write clean code.
- Create a responsive design.
- Handle error cases.
- Use the latest libraries and technologies.
- Tested code is a big plus.

### User experience

The features of the app might be few, but we expect you to deliver a solution with a high user experience. Imagine this application to be used by real users, with real needs. Make it interesting, fun and intuitive to use. And of course you are allowed to extend your applications functionality.

### Code

We expect that the code is of high quality and under source control. Expect the solution to be continuously worked on by other developers and should therefore be easy to understand, adjust and extend. True beauty starts on the inside!

## Delivery

Fork the repository, code in your fork and make a pull request when done. A nice commit history describing your work is preferred over squashing it into one commit.
Also send us an e-mail to let us know!

### Good luck!
